* USERCOMMAND -
    USERCOMMAND - the USER_COMMAND function code (FC) is used
    to capture user actions or interactions  with the graphical
    user interface (GUI) elements. These actions can include
    pressing function keys, clicking buttons,  selecting menu
    items, or any other user-initiated event within an ABAP
    program.
* FC ( FUNCTION CODE ) -
   In SAP ABAP, `FC1` is a specific function code that represents
    the action of pressing the F1 key on the keyboard.
    When a user presses the F1 key, `FC1` is set in `SY-UCOMM` system field to indicate this action.
    This allows the ABAP program to recognize that the has
    requested help and respond such as displaying help information
    or invoking a function.
* CASE SY-UCOMM -
    Think of SY-UCOMM as a special message board inside an
    ABAP program. Whenever a user does something, like clicking
    a button or pressing a key, SY-UCOMM gets updated with a code
    that represents that action. The program then checks this
    message board to see what the user did and responds accordingly.
    It's like the program's way of understanding  what the user
    wants to do next.

* CONCATENATE:
    SYNTAX -
     "CONCATENATE S1 S2 INTO MSG SEPERATED BY SPACE"
       MSG IS VARIABLE DECLARED


  The CONCATENATE statement is used to combine multiple text
  strings or variables into a single string. In this case, STR1
  and STR2 are concatenated together to form the message MSG, with
   a space separating them. So, MSG will contain the text "THE DIFF OF
   2 NO IS" followed by the value of Z.

* MESSAGE:
   SYNTAX -
     MESSAGE MSG TYPE 'I'.
       I REPRESENTS DATATYPE INTEGER.
       MSG IS VARAIBLE NAME.

 The MESSAGE statement is used to display a message to the
 user during program execution. Here, the concatenated message MSG is
 displayed as an informative message (TYPE 'I'). This message will
 Typically appear in a dialog box or at the bottom of the screen,
 depending on the SAP GUI configuration.
